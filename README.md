NLP Project 1:
In this project, movie synopsis data sourced from IMDB and Wiki were preprocessed through tonikization, removal of package-defined stopwords and stemming using nltk package. 
Later, I built a Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) model to extract features, calculated document similarity, and loaded into models including K-means, Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) and PCA. 
After training models, top latent topics & words for each rating were identified. I performed topic modeling to discover hidden semantic structures by using LDA technique, and visualized training results after reduced dimension via PCA.
